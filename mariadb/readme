Description:
Dockerfile for building MariaDB (mysql) database sever under Fedora. It
prepares DB directory under container's /var/lib/mysql, but you can use your
on volume with just mount it to this place.

Usage:
docker build -t mariadb .
docker run -d -p 3306:3306 -v /data/mariadb:/var/lib/mysql mariadb

Known bugs:
- a serious one: can't login from another machines :)
